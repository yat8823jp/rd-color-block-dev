# üì¶ `create-guten-block`

>`create-guten-block` is _zero configuration dev-toolkit_ (#0CJS) to develop WordPress Gutenberg blocks in a matter of minutes without configuring `React`, `webpack`, `ES6/7/8/Next`, `ESLint`, `Babel`, etc.

Create Guten Block is not like other [starter-kits](https://github.com/ahmadawais/wpgulp) or [boilerplates](https://github.com/ahmadawais/Gutenberg-boilerplate). It's a developer's toolbox which is continuously updated. Since it has zero-configuration, you can always update it without any changes in your code.

`create-guten-block` is:
- ü•û Versioned ‚úì
- ü§† Updatable ‚úì
- üóÉ Set of sane-defaults ‚úì
- üêé ONE single `cgb-scripts` dependency ‚úì

<br>

![Start](https://on.ahmda.ws/osd3/c)

## GETTING STARTED!

Let's create a WordPress block plugin...

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Overview

Run step `#1` and `#2` quickly in one go ‚Äî Run inside local WP install   E.g. `/wp.local/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
```sh
npx create-guten-block my-block
cd my-block
npm start
```
([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/ahmadawais/e4c69b22561c7079c9d99faba90e3b23))


> üéõ   _If you want to study the detailed installation of step `#1` and `#2` ‚Äî then take a look at the steps below_.


<details>
 <summary><strong> STEP #0</strong> ‚Äî Don't have <code>Node.js</code> + <code>npm</code> installed? Read this. (CLICK TO EXPAND!)</summary>

In case you are an absolute beginner to the world of `Node.js`, JavaScript, and `npm` packages ‚Äî all you need to do is go to the Node's site [download + install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Node on your system. This will install both `Node.js` and `npm`, i.e., node package manager ‚Äî the command line interface of Node.js.

You can verify the install by opening your terminal app and typing...

```sh
node -v
# Results into v9.1.0 ‚Äî make sure you have Node >= 8 installed.

npm -v
# Results into 5.6.0 ‚Äî make sure you have npm >= 5.3 installed.
```

</details>

### ‚Üí STEP #1

All you have to do is run the following command and it will create a WordPress block plugin. It's done by installing and running the `create-guten-block` command and providing it with a unique name for a WordPress plugin that will get created.


> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure run this command in your local WordPress install's plugins folder i.e. `/local_dev_site.tld/wp-content/plugins/` folder ‚Äî since this command will produce a WordPress plugin that you can go to `WP Admin` ‚ñ∂Ô∏é `Plugins` to activate.

```sh
npx create-guten-block my-block
```
([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/ahmadawais/e4c69b22561c7079c9d99faba90e3b23))

![npx block](https://on.ahmda.ws/p89T/c)

_It'll take a couple of minutes to install._

>You‚Äôll need to have Node >= 8 and npm >= 5.3 on your local development machine (but it‚Äôs not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

It will create a directory called `my-block` inside the current folder.
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```sh
INSIDE: /local_dev_site.tld/wp-content/plugins/my-block

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
|
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist
|  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blocks.build.js
|  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blocks.editor.build.css
|  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ blocks.style.build.css
|
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ block
   |  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ block.js
   |  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ editor.scss
   |  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ style.scss
   |
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blocks.js
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common.scss
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ init.php
```
No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.

### ‚Üí STEP #2

Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder and run the start script.

_Let's do that._

```sh
cd my-block
npm start
```
_You can also use `yarn start` if that's your jam_.

![cgb-npm-start](https://on.ahmda.ws/orrh/c)

This runs the plugin in development mode. To produce production code run `npm run build`.
You will see the build messages, errors, and lint warnings in the console.

>And just like that, you're building your next WordPress plugin with Gutenberg, React.js, ES 6/7/8/Next, transpiled with Babel, which also has ESLint configurations for your code editor to pick up and use automatically.

<br>

![More](https://on.ahmda.ws/orsm/c)

### Workflow!

There are just three scripts that you can use in your `create-guten-block` workflow. With these three scripts, you can develop, build, and eject your plugin.

#### üëâ  `npm start`
- Use to compile and run the block in development mode.
- Watches for any changes and reports back any errors in your code.

#### üëâ  `npm run build`
- Use to build production code for your block inside `dist` folder.
- Runs once and reports back the gzip file sizes of the produced code.

#### üëâ  `npm run eject`
- Use to eject your plugin out of `create-guten-block`.
- Provides all the configurations so you can customize the project as you want.
- It's a one-way street, `eject` and you have to maintain everything yourself.
- You don't normally have to `eject` a project because by ejecting you lose the connection with `create-guten-block` and from there onwards you have to update and maintain all the dependencies on your own.

_That's about it._

<br>

![included](https://on.ahmda.ws/orOe/c)

## What‚Äôs Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern next-gen WordPress Gutenberg plugin:

* React, JSX, and ES6 syntax support.
* webpack dev/production build process behind the scene.
* Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
* Auto-prefixed CSS, so you don‚Äôt need `-webkit` or other prefixes.
* A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production with source-maps.
* Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency `cgb-scripts`.

The tradeoff is that **these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way**. If your project needs more customization, you can ["eject"](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block#--npm-run-eject) and customize it, but then you will need to maintain this configuration.


<br>

![Philosophy](https://on.ahmda.ws/orq5/c)

## Philosophy

* **One Dependency:** There is just one build dependency. It uses webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.

* **No Configuration Required:** You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.

* **No Lock-In:** You can `eject` to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.

<br>

![Why](https://on.ahmda.ws/orvy/c)

## Why `create-guten-block`?

Well, it's really hard to configure things like webpack, React, ES 6/7/8/Next, ESLint, Babel, etc. before you even start writing a Hello World gutenberg block. Then there's the fact that you have to maintain and constantly update your configuration with all the new tools and growth in the JavaScript community.

`create-guten-block` hides all this configuration away in an optimized package that we call `cgb-scripts`. This package is the only dependency in your projects. We keep `cgb-scripts` up to date while you go ahead and create the next best WordPress themes and plugins.

<br>

![tldr](https://on.ahmda.ws/osPO/c)

## TL;DR

>Too long, didn't read? Here's a shorter version.

Open the terminal app and run the following commands.

- üî∞ **Install/Create**: `npx create-guten-block my-block` ‚Äî Run inside local WP install   E.g. `/wp.local/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
- üìÇ **Browse**: `cd my-block` ‚Äî Open the newly created plugin directory.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Run**: `npm start` ‚Äî For development.
- üì¶ **Run**: `npm run build` ‚Äî For production build.
- ‚èè **Run**: `npm run eject` ‚Äî To customize, update, and maintain all by yourself.

Create-Guten-Block has been tested to work on macOS, but must also work on Windows, and Linux.

![update](https://on.ahmda.ws/osO7/c)

## Updating to New Releases

Create Guten Block is divided into two packages:

1. **`create-guten-block`** is a command-line utility that you use to create new WP Gutenberg plugins.
1. **`cgb-scripts`** is a development dependency in the generated plugin projects.

You never need to update `create-guten-block` itself as it's run via [`npx`](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) and it delegates all the setup to `cgb-scripts`.

When you run `create-guten-block`, it always creates the project with the latest version of `cgb-scripts` so you‚Äôll get all the new features and improvements in newly created plugins automatically.

To update an existing project to a new version of `cgb-scripts`, open the [changelog](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block#changelog), find the version you‚Äôre currently on (check package.json in your plugin's folder if you‚Äôre not sure), and apply the migration instructions for the newer versions.

In most cases bumping the `cgb-scripts` version in package.json and running `npm install` in this folder should be enough, but it‚Äôs good to consult the [changelog](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block#changelog) for potential breaking changes.

We commit to keeping the breaking changes minimal so you can upgrade `cgb-scripts` painlessly.
